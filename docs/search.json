    "text": "What is a Time Series? A time series is any sequence of measurements taken at regular, equally spaced intervals—seconds, minutes, hours, days, months, quarters, or years. Common examples include weather (daily temperature or rainfall), financial markets (daily stock prices or returns), industry indicators (monthly production or sales), electricity demand, traffic counts, and hospital admissions. In time-series analysis we study how these values evolve: their level, trend, seasonal or calendar patterns (e.g., weekdays vs. weekends, holiday effects), cycles, and anomalies. Typical goals are to describe behavior clearly, forecast future values, and quantify the impact of events or policies.\nBecause observations are ordered in time, nearby points tend to be correlated (autocorrelation). This violates the independent-and-identically-distributed assumption behind many standard statistical methods, so naïve cross-sectional tools often mislead. Time-series work must explicitly handle dependence, trend, and seasonality—for example by differencing, seasonal adjustment, and models that use lagged values and errors (e.g., ARIMA/SARIMA, ARIMAX/SARIMAX with external drivers, VAR for multiple series, state-space/ETS, or GARCH when volatility changes over time). Analysts also watch for structural breaks (e.g., policy shifts, COVID), outliers, and missing periods, and they evaluate models with time-aware validation (rolling or blocked splits) rather than random shuffles."

    "text": "Data source 1: Yield Curve\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThese datasets contain yield curve information for both the United States and Korea. Yield curves represent benchmark borrowing costs across short- and long-term maturities. The difference between long- and short-term yields (“the slope”) reflects market expectations about growth and inflation. The U.S. yield curve will be used primarily to capture U.S. economic conditions, while the Korean yield curve will measure how U.S. rate movements influence Korean bonds. The analysis focuses on the spread between 3-year (short-term) and 10-year (long-term) maturities.\nUS yield curve\nkorea yield curve\n\n\nData source 2: FX spot rate data\n\nThis dataset records the daily exchange rate of the Korean Won (KRW) against the U.S. Dollar (USD). The FX rate is central to understanding the U.S. dollar’s influence on Korea’s financial markets. It allows the detection of turning points, trend shifts, and day-to-day volatility, helping to evaluate how U.S. rate shocks and dollar movements transmit into the Korean currency market.\nKorean won(KRW) data\n\n\nData source 3: Yahoo finance\n\nYahoo Finance provides accessible and reliable financial market data. In this project, it is used to obtain stock market indices such as the KOSPI—the main benchmark for Korean equities,U.S. Dollar Index (DXY) and S&P500 index. These data support analyses linking stock performance and currency strength to U.S. interest rate movements. For this project yfinance via python will be used to access dataset and store to my folder.\nyahoo finance\n\nKOSPI index yfinance code\n\n\nCode\nimport yfinance as yf\nimport pandas as pd\n\nticker = \"^KS11\"\ndata = yf.download(ticker, start=\"1990-01-02\", end=None, interval=\"1d\", progress=False)\n#data.to_csv(\"kospi.csv\")\n\n\n\n\nUSD index yfinance code\n\n\nCode\nimport yfinance as yf\nimport pandas as pd\n\nticker = \"DX-Y.NYB\"\ndata = yf.download(ticker, start=\"1981-04-13\", end=None, interval=\"1d\", progress=False)\n\n#data.to_csv(\"usd_index.csv\")\n\n\n\n\nS&P500 index yfinance code\n\n\nCode\nimport yfinance as yf\nimport pandas as pd\nsp500 = yf.download(\"^GSPC\", start=\"1990-01-02\")\n#sp500.to_csv(\"sp500.csv\")\n\n\n\n\n\nData source 4: Korea import & export data\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis dataset reports Korea’s imports and exports with the United States, measured in thousands of U.S. dollars over time. Since Korea’s economy is heavily export-oriented, t rade data are crucial for assessing how U.S. economic developments—through growth momentum, dollar fluctuations, and rate differentials—affect Korea’s trade performance. This dataset supports the examination of transmission channels between U.S. shocks and Korea’s real economy.\ntrade data\n\n\nData source 5: korean housing data\n\nThis dataset provides the residential property price index for Korea, specifically the Seoul metropolitan area. Given that the housing market represents one of Korea’s largest sectors, changes in property prices and transactions are key indicators of domestic financial conditions. This data enables analysis of how U.S. economic conditions and interest rate changes affect Korea’s housing affordability, financing costs, and overall market activity.\nhousing data\n\n\nData source 6 : FRED effective rate\n\nThis dataset provides the Effective Federal Funds Rate (EFFR) from the Federal Reserve Economic Data (FRED). The effective rate reflects the average interest rate at which depository institutions lend balances to each other overnight and serves as the key indicator of U.S. monetary policy stance. In this project, the FRED rate data represent the foundation of U.S. policy movements, used to identify tightening or easing cycles, measure interest-rate shocks, and analyze how U.S. monetary changes transmit to Korean financial markets, including bond yields, FX, and equity valuations.\nFRED rate\n\n\nDate source 7: Bank of Korea base rate\n\nThis dataset contains the Bank of Korea (BoK) Base Rate, which is the main policy rate set by the BoK’s Monetary Policy Board. The base rate determines short-term money market conditions and anchors borrowing and lending rates across Korea’s financial system. In this project, the BoK rate is used to evaluate domestic monetary policy reactions to external U.S. rate movements. Comparing shifts in the BoK base rate with changes in the FRED effective rate allows identification of synchronization or divergence between the two central banks’ policies and their effects on Korea’s yield curve, currency, and real economy.\nBOK rate"

Seasonality is negligible and does not grow with the level—typical of policy rates that move in discrete steps rather than proportional swings. The remainder is episodic (crisis windows) but its magnitude is broadly stable in absolute terms. That pattern supports an additive decomposition.\n\n\n\n\nCode\ndecompose_kr_ts&lt;- decompose(kr_ts)\nautoplot(decompose_kr_ts,main = \"decomposition: KRW/USD FX rate\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe trend reflects multi-year won weakness/strength cycles, with standout moves in 2008–09 and again around 2022. Seasonality is mild and appears roughly constant in absolute size; it doesn’t fan out as the level drifts, so an additive form is better option.\n\n\n\n\nCode\ndecompose_import_ts&lt;- decompose(import_ts)\nautoplot(decompose_import_ts,main = \"decomposition: trade import South Korea vs USA\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCode\ndecompose_import_ts1&lt;- decompose(export_ts,\"multiplicative\")\nautoplot(decompose_import_ts1,main = \"decomposition: trade import South Korea vs USA(multiplicative)\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe trend shows a secular rise with cyclical dents (late 1990s, GFC, 2020) consistent with globalization and demand cycles. In levels, the seasonal pattern clearly widens over time and the remainder becomes more volatile as the series grows—classic heteroskedasticity that violates additive assumptions. On a multiplicative scale, seasonality becomes approximately constant in percentage terms, and the remainder tightens around zero. This yields a cleaner, more interpretable decomposition for strictly positive, growing trade flows.\n\n\n\n\nCode\ndecompose_export_ts&lt;- decompose(export_ts)\nautoplot(decompose_export_ts,main = \"decomposition: trade export South Korea vs USA(additive)\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCode\ndecompose_export_ts1&lt;- decompose(export_ts,\"multiplicative\")\nautoplot(decompose_export_ts1,main = \"decomposition: trade export South Korea vs USA(multiplicative)\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExports exhibit a strong upward trend with cyclical pauses and a noticeable surge post-2016 before cooling. The additive view shows seasonality and residual variance that expand alongside the level, indicating proportional—not absolute—effects. Switching to multiplicative stabilizes both, turning the seasonal shape into a near-constant proportion of the level and shrinking the remainder to a level-invariant band. That makes inference about turning points in the trend more reliable.\n\n\n\n\nCode\ndecompose_3y_ts&lt;- decompose(yield_3y_ts)\nautoplot(decompose_3y_ts,main = \"decomposition: USA & South korea yield spread rate(3y)\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe trend meanders from negative values in the early 2000s toward positive territory around the late 2010s before sliding again, mirroring cross-country policy cycles and term-structure dynamics. Because the series crosses zero and can be negative, multiplicative models are not meaningful here. The seasonal component is modest and stable; the remainder features short bursts of volatility (pandemic, 2023) that don’t scale with the spread’s absolute level. An additive decomposition is therefore appropriate.\n\n\n\n\nCode\ndecompose_10y_ts&lt;- decompose(yield_10y_ts)\nautoplot(decompose_10y_ts,main =  \"decomposition: USA & South korea yield spread rate(10y)\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThere is upward trend through the mid-2010s gives way to a more pronounced decline after 2021, highlighting shifts in long-run rate differentials. As with the 3-year, the spread can be near or below zero, which rules out multiplicative forms. Seasonality is small, and the remainder shows occasional spikes that are fairly constant in absolute magnitude. The overall structure fits best with an additive model.\n\n\n\n\nCode\ndecompose_housing_ts&lt;- decompose(house_ts)\nautoplot(decompose_housing_ts,main = \"decomposition: Seoul housing property index\" )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe trend rises steadily, quickening around 2019–2021 before easing, while the seasonal component stays roughly the same amplitude across the sample, not widening as the index level increases. That constancy in absolute seasonal size argues for an additive form rather than multiplicative. The remainder shows episodic bumps—policy moves and sentiment shifts—but its variance doesn’t systematically scale with the level, so an additive decomposition cleanly separates the smooth trend\n\n\n\n\nCode\ndecompose_usd_ts&lt;- decompose(usd_ts_log)\nautoplot(decompose_usd_ts, main= \"decomposition: USD index\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe trend captures well-known dollar cycles (strong mid-1980s, mid-2010s; softer interludes) while the seasonal component is persistent but proportionate to the level. In raw levels, the remainder tends to be larger when the index is higher; logging or using a multiplicative form evens that out. Decomposing multiplicatively yields cleaner inference: seasonality as a percent swing and a remainder that is closer to level-invariant.\n\n\n\n\nCode\ndecompose_kospi_ts&lt;- decompose(kospi_ts_log)\nautoplot(decompose_kospi_ts,main = \"decomposition: KOSPI index\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe trend reflects a secular climb punctuated by sharp drawdowns (GFC, COVID, 2022–23). Equity markets exhibit volatility clustering and proportional variation: the seasonal and remainder amplitudes grow as the level rises. On logs (or multiplicatively), the seasonal share becomes roughly constant and the residual shocks are better behaved. This improves signal extraction around turning points and reduces spurious variance in the remainder.\n\n\n\n\nCode\ndecompose_sp_ts&lt;- decompose(sp_ts_log)\nautoplot(decompose_sp_ts,main = \"decomposition: S&P500 index\" )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA strong upward trend dominates, with pauses and breaks around 2000–02, 2008–09, and 2020 before resuming higher. Seasonality is small but inherently proportional in equity prices, and the remainder is much noisier in bull markets when viewed in levels. A multiplicative/log-additive decomposition stabilizes variance, rendering seasonality as a constant percentage and isolating shocks without level-driven inflation of the residual. This specification typically produces the most interpretable components for stock indices.\n\n\n\n\n\nACF & PACF plot\n\nSouth korea base rateFederal Reserve RateKRW/USD FX ratetrade import South Korea vs USAtrade export South Korea vs USAUSA & South Korea yield spread rate(3Y)USA & South Korea yield spread rate(10Y)Seoul housing property indexUSD indexKOSPI indexS&P500 index\n\n\n\n\nCode\nggAcf(bok_ts) +\n  geom_segment(aes(xend = lag, yend = 0), color=\"blue\") +\n  labs(title = \"ACF of South Korea base rate\") +\n  theme_bw()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCode\nggPacf(bok_ts) +\n  geom_segment(aes(xend = lag, yend = 0), color=\"red\") +\n  labs(title = \"PACF of South Korea base rate\") +\n  theme_bw()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe ACF shows a very slow, gradual decay with high correlations extending well beyond lag 20, remaining above 0.25 throughout. The PACF shows a single strong spike at lag 1 of approximately 0.95, then cuts off sharply afterward with all subsequent lags staying within the confidence bounds. This is a classic signature of a highly persistent autoregressive process. This series is clearly non-stationary. The slow decay in the ACF is a classic signature of a unit root or near-unit root process. The PACF pattern suggests an AR(1) process with a coefficient very close to 1, indicating a random walk or highly persistent process. This makes economic sense as central banks adjust interest rates gradually rather than making abrupt changes. First differencing would be needed to achieve stationarity\n\n\n\n\nCode\nggAcf(usr_ts) +\n  geom_segment(aes(xend = lag, yend = 0), color=\"blue\") +\n  labs(title = \"ACF of Federal Reserve Rate \") +\n  theme_bw()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCode\nggPacf(usr_ts) +\n  geom_segment(aes(xend = lag, yend = 0), color=\"red\") +\n  labs(title = \"PACF of Federal Reserve Rate \") +\n  theme_bw()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe ACF shows slow decay similar to the South Korea rate, though slightly faster, with correlations gradually declining but remaining substantial even at longer lags. The PACF shows a dominant spike at lag 1 of approximately 0.95, with subsequent lags mostly within bounds, though there are some minor scattered exceedances at longer lags. This series is also non-stationary with similar characteristics to the South Korea rate. The persistent autocorrelation indicates the series has memory and trends, which aligns with how the Federal Reserve conducts monetary policy through gradual adjustments. The slow decay pattern confirms that the series doesn’t revert to a mean quickly. Differencing is required for stationarity before any modeling can proceed.\n\n\n\n\nCode\nggAcf(kr_ts,lag.max = 50) +\n  geom_segment(aes(xend = lag, yend = 0), color=\"blue\") +\n  labs(title = \"ACF of KRW/USD FX rate\") +\n  theme_bw()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCode\nggPacf(kr_ts,lag.max = 50) +\n  geom_segment(aes(xend = lag, yend = 0), color=\"red\") +\n  labs(title = \"PACF of  KRW/USD FX rate\") +\n  theme_bw()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe ACF shows extremely strong persistence with correlations near 1.0 extending across all 50+ lags with barely any decay visible. The PACF shows a massive spike at lag 1 of approximately 1.0, followed by an immediate and complete cutoff with all other lags remaining within the confidence bounds. This is perhaps the clearest example of a pure random walk in the dataset. This series is strongly non-stationary and represents an almost perfect random walk. The ACF barely decays at all, which is characteristic behavior for exchange rates in floating rate regimes. Exchange rates typically follow random walk processes as they respond to news and changing economic conditions without mean reversion. This series definitely requires first differencing, or preferably a returns transformation, to achieve stationarity.\n\n\n\n\nCode\nggAcf(import_ts) +\n  geom_segment(aes(xend = lag, yend = 0), color=\"blue\") +\n  labs(title = \"ACF of trade import South Korea vs USA\") +\n  theme_bw()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCode\nggPacf(import_ts) +\n  geom_segment(aes(xend = lag, yend = 0), color=\"red\") +\n  labs(title = \"PACF of trade import South Korea vs USA\") +\n  theme_bw()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe ACF shows very high initial values with slow decay, remaining above 0.7 even at lag 24, indicating strong persistence in the series. The PACF shows a very strong spike at lag 1 of approximately 0.95, then a smaller but still significant spike at lag 2, followed by scattered minor spikes at various longer lags within or just outside the confidence bounds. This series is non-stationary with strong persistence. The PACF suggests this might be an AR(2) process in differences, or possibly requires seasonal differencing given the trade data nature. Trade flows typically have both trend components and potential seasonal patterns. First differencing is recommended, and you may want to check for seasonal patterns that would require additional seasonal differencing or adjustment.\n\n\n\n\nCode\nggAcf(export_ts) +\n  geom_segment(aes(xend = lag, yend = 0), color=\"blue\") +\n  labs(title = \"ACF of trade export South Korea vs USA\") +\n  theme_bw()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCode\nggPacf(export_ts) +\n  geom_segment(aes(xend = lag, yend = 0), color=\"red\") +\n  labs(title = \"PACF of trade export South Korea vs USA\") +\n  theme_bw()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe ACF pattern is very similar to the import series, showing slow decay with high persistence and correlations remaining elevated throughout the lag structure. The PACF shows a dominant lag 1 spike of approximately 0.95, a smaller but noticeable lag 2 spike, and then mostly lags within bounds with occasional minor exceedances at longer lags. This series is non-stationary with characteristics nearly identical to the import series. This similarity makes economic sense as exports and imports often move together and share common trends related to economic cycles and bilateral trade relationships. First differencing is needed, and like the import series, you should consider checking for seasonal patterns that might require additional treatment beyond simple first differencing.\n\n\n\n\nCode\nggAcf(yield_3y_ts,lag.max = 50) +\n  geom_segment(aes(xend = lag, yend = 0), color=\"blue\") +\n  labs(title = \"ACF of USA & South Korea yield spread rate(3Y)\") +\n  theme_bw()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCode\nggPacf(yield_3y_ts,lag.max = 50) +\n  geom_segment(aes(xend = lag, yend = 0), color=\"red\") +\n  labs(title = \"PACF of USA & South Korea yield spread rate(3Y)\") +\n  theme_bw()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe ACF shows extremely high persistence with correlations remaining near 1.0 across all 50 lags, displaying almost no decay whatsoever. The PACF shows a dominant spike at lag 1 of approximately 0.99, followed by a small spike at lag 2, after which all subsequent lags remain within the confidence bounds. This represents one of the most persistent series in the dataset. This series is clearly non-stationary and exhibits random walk behavior. The yield spread between the two countries appears to drift over time without any mean reversion, possibly reflecting changing perceptions of relative risk, monetary policy divergence, or capital flow patterns. First differencing is absolutely required before any modeling can be performed on this series.\n\n\n\n\nCode\nggAcf(yield_10y_ts,lag.max = 50) +\n  geom_segment(aes(xend = lag, yend = 0), color=\"blue\") +\n  labs(title = \"ACF of USA & South Korea yield spread rate(10Y)\") +\n  theme_bw()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCode\nggPacf(yield_10y_ts,lag.max = 50) +\n  geom_segment(aes(xend = lag, yend = 0), color=\"red\") +\n  labs(title = \"PACF of USA & South Korea yield spread rate(10Y)\") +\n  theme_bw()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe ACF pattern is nearly identical to the 3Y spread, showing very high persistence across all lags with correlations staying close to 1.0 throughout the entire lag structure. The PACF displays the same structure with a strong lag 1 spike of approximately 0.99, a smaller but noticeable lag 2 spike, and then a sharp cutoff with all remaining lags within bounds. This series is strongly non-stationary. Both the 3Y and 10Y spreads show identical non-stationary behavior, which suggests persistent divergences or convergences in the yield curves between the two countries driven by common factors. The similarity between the two maturities suggests they might be cointegrated. This series requires first differencing before it can be used in any time series models.\n\n\n\n\nCode\nggAcf(house_ts) +\n  geom_segment(aes(xend = lag, yend = 0), color=\"blue\") +\n  labs(title = \"ACF of Seoul housing  property index \") +\n  theme_bw()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCode\nggPacf(house_ts) +\n  geom_segment(aes(xend = lag, yend = 0), color=\"red\") +\n  labs(title = \"PACF of Seoul housing  property index \") +\n  theme_bw()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe ACF shows a slow, linear decay pattern starting from about 0.98 and gradually declining to approximately 0.55 by lag 24, representing moderately fast decay compared to financial indices. The PACF displays a massive spike at lag 1 of about 0.98, after which all subsequent lags remain comfortably within the confidence bounds with no other significant spikes visible. This series is non-stationary as expected for real estate price indices, which typically trend upward over time due to population growth, income increases, and inflation. The decay in the ACF is somewhat faster than pure financial indices, possibly reflecting some degree of mean reversion in housing markets. First differencing is needed before modeling this series, and seasonal adjustment might also be worth considering.\n\n\n\n\nCode\nggAcf(usd_ts_log,lag.max = 50) +\n  geom_segment(aes(xend = lag, yend = 0), color=\"blue\") +\n  labs(title = \"ACF of USD index\") +\n  theme_bw()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCode\nggPacf(usd_ts_log,lag.max = 50) +\n  geom_segment(aes(xend = lag, yend = 0), color=\"red\") +\n  labs(title = \"PACF of USD index\") +\n  theme_bw()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe ACF shows near-perfect persistence with correlations at 1.0 extending uniformly across all 50+ lags without any visible decay throughout the entire range. The PACF displays an almost perfect spike at lag 1 approaching 1.0, followed by an immediate and complete cutoff to values near zero for all remaining lags. This is perhaps the most extreme example of random walk behavior in the entire dataset. This series is extremely non-stationary, exhibiting textbook random walk characteristics. Dollar indices tend to follow this pattern as they drift based on relative monetary policy stances, economic conditions across countries, and international capital flows. The complete lack of mean reversion indicates the dollar’s value can move in any direction for extended periods. First differencing or computing log returns is definitely required before any analysis or modeling can proceed.\n\n\n\n\nCode\nggAcf(kospi_ts_log,lag.max = 50) +\n  geom_segment(aes(xend = lag, yend = 0), color=\"blue\") +\n  labs(title = \"ACF of KOSPI index\") +\n  theme_bw()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCode\nggPacf(kospi_ts_log,lag.max = 50) +\n  geom_segment(aes(xend = lag, yend = 0), color=\"red\") +\n  labs(title = \"PACF of KOSPI index\") +\n  theme_bw()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe ACF shows extremely high persistence with correlations remaining near 1.0 across all 50 lags without meaningful decay, indicating very strong memory in the series. The PACF displays a dominant lag 1 spike of approximately 0.99 followed by an immediate cutoff, with all subsequent lags staying within the confidence bounds. This is the standard pattern observed for equity price indices worldwide. This series is strongly non-stationary, which is typical behavior for stock market indices. Like most equity indices worldwide, KOSPI follows a random walk with long-term upward trends reflecting economic growth and corporate earnings expansion, but no reversion to a fixed mean level. First differencing is required, though using log returns would be even better for financial analysis purposes as they have better statistical properties.\n\n\n\n\nCode\nggAcf(sp_ts_log,lag.max = 50) +\n  geom_segment(aes(xend = lag, yend = 0), color=\"blue\") +\n  labs(title = \"ACF of S&P500 index\") +\n  theme_bw()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCode\nggPacf(sp_ts_log,lag.max = 50) +\n  geom_segment(aes(xend = lag, yend = 0), color=\"red\") +\n  labs(title = \"PACF of S&P500 index\") +\n  theme_bw()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe ACF pattern is virtually identical to the KOSPI, showing near-perfect persistence with correlations at 1.0 across all lags without any visible decay. The PACF shows the characteristic lag 1 spike of approximately 1.0 with a sharp, immediate cutoff afterward. All remaining lags stay comfortably within the confidence bounds, confirming the unit root structure typical of equity indices. This series is strongly non-stationary and exhibits classic random walk behavior identical to the KOSPI. This similarity confirms that equity indices worldwide share common stochastic properties regardless of the specific market or country, reflecting the general nature of stock prices. First differencing or log returns are required before any modeling, with log returns being strongly preferred for financial applications due to their better distributional properties and interpretation as continuously compounded returns.\n\n\n\n\n\nAugmented Dickey-Fuller Test\n\nSouth korea base rateFederal Reserve rateKRW/USD FX ratetrade import South Korea vs USAtrade export South Korea vs USAUSA & South korea yield spread rate(3y)USA & South korea yield spread rate(10y)seoul housing property indexUSD indexKOSPI indexS&P500 index\n\n\n\n\nCode\nadf.test(bok_ts)\n\n\n\n    Augmented Dickey-Fuller Test\n\ndata:  bok_ts\nDickey-Fuller = -1.6484, Lag order = 4, p-value = 0.7225\nalternative hypothesis: stationary\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCode\nadf.test(usr_ts)\n\n\n\n    Augmented Dickey-Fuller Test\n\ndata:  usr_ts\nDickey-Fuller = -2.6475, Lag order = 4, p-value = 0.308\nalternative hypothesis: stationary\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCode\nadf.test(kr_ts)\n\n\n\n    Augmented Dickey-Fuller Test\n\ndata:  kr_ts\nDickey-Fuller = -2.0722, Lag order = 22, p-value = 0.5478\nalternative hypothesis: stationary\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCode\nadf.test(import_ts)\n\n\n\n    Augmented Dickey-Fuller Test\n\ndata:  import_ts\nDickey-Fuller = -2.9309, Lag order = 7, p-value = 0.1841\nalternative hypothesis: stationary\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCode\nadf.test(export_ts)\n\n\n\n    Augmented Dickey-Fuller Test\n\ndata:  export_ts\nDickey-Fuller = -2.0023, Lag order = 7, p-value = 0.5762\nalternative hypothesis: stationary\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCode\nadf.test(yield_3y_ts)\n\n\n\n    Augmented Dickey-Fuller Test\n\ndata:  yield_3y_ts\nDickey-Fuller = -1.7543, Lag order = 18, p-value = 0.6824\nalternative hypothesis: stationary\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCode\nadf.test(yield_10y_ts)\n\n\n\n    Augmented Dickey-Fuller Test\n\ndata:  yield_10y_ts\nDickey-Fuller = -2.7481, Lag order = 18, p-value = 0.2615\nalternative hypothesis: stationary\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCode\nadf.test(house_ts)\n\n\n\n    Augmented Dickey-Fuller Test\n\ndata:  house_ts\nDickey-Fuller = -2.556, Lag order = 6, p-value = 0.3418\nalternative hypothesis: stationary\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCode\nadf.test(usd_ts_log)\n\n\n\n    Augmented Dickey-Fuller Test\n\ndata:  usd_ts_log\nDickey-Fuller = -2.1606, Lag order = 22, p-value = 0.5103\nalternative hypothesis: stationary\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCode\nadf.test(kospi_ts_log)\n\n\n\n    Augmented Dickey-Fuller Test\n\ndata:  kospi_ts_log\nDickey-Fuller = -1.24, Lag order = 19, p-value = 0.9001\nalternative hypothesis: stationary\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCode\nadf.test(sp_ts_log)\n\n\n\n    Augmented Dickey-Fuller Test\n\ndata:  sp_ts_log\nDickey-Fuller = -1.758, Lag order = 20, p-value = 0.6809\nalternative hypothesis: stationary\n\n\n\n\n\nFor all plots, the p-value is greater than 0.05, which fails to reject null hypothesis.

This differenced series appears to be stationary and close to white noise.

Most other lags remain within bounds with scattered minor exceedances. The PACF shows positive spikes at lags 5, 12, and 24, with most other lags within bounds, reinforcing the suggestion of seasonality in the data. This series appears stationary after first differencing, but exhibits clear seasonal patterns.\n\n\n\n\nCode\nyield_3y_ts_diff &lt;- diff(yield_3y_ts)\n\nggAcf(yield_3y_ts_diff,lag.max = 50) +\n  geom_segment(aes(xend = lag, yend = 0), color=\"blue\") +\n  labs(title = \"Differenced: ACF of USA & South Korea yield spread rate(3Y)\") +\n  theme_bw()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCode\nggPacf(yield_3y_ts_diff,lag.max = 50) +\n  geom_segment(aes(xend = lag, yend = 0), color=\"red\") +\n  labs(title = \"Differenced: PACF of USA & South Korea yield spread rate(3Y)\") +\n  theme_bw()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe ACF shows a very large negative spike at lag 1 (approximately -0.12), with all other lags appearing as small random fluctuations within the confidence bounds. The PACF displays a similar pattern with a large negative spike at lag 1 and all other lags remaining comfortably within bounds. The correlations are much smaller in magnitude compared to the interest rate series. This series appears stationary after first differencing.\n\n\n\n\nCode\nyield_10y_ts_diff &lt;- diff(yield_10y_ts)\n\nggAcf(yield_10y_ts_diff,lag.max = 50) +\n  geom_segment(aes(xend = lag, yend = 0), color=\"blue\") +\n  labs(title = \"Differenced: ACF of USA & South Korea yield spread rate(10Y)\") +\n  theme_bw()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCode\nggPacf(yield_10y_ts_diff,lag.max = 50) +\n  geom_segment(aes(xend = lag, yend = 0), color=\"red\") +\n  labs(title = \"Differenced: PACF of USA & South Korea yield spread rate(10Y)\") +\n  theme_bw()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe ACF shows a large negative spike at lag 1 (approximately -0.11), with scattered small spikes throughout but most remaining within bounds. There are some notable spikes around lags 8, 40-42, and 49. The PACF shows a similar large negative spike at lag 1, with most other lags within bounds except for some minor exceedances at longer lags around 40-50. This series is stationary after first differencing, very similar to the 3Y spread.\n\n\n\n\nCode\nhouse_dlog &lt;- diff(house_ts)\n\nggAcf(house_dlog) +\n  geom_segment(aes(xend = lag, yend = 0), color=\"blue\") +\n  labs(title = \"Differenced: ACF of Seoul housing  property index \") +\n  theme_bw()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCode\nggPacf(house_dlog) +\n  geom_segment(aes(xend = lag, yend = 0), color=\"red\") +\n  labs(title = \"Differenced: PACF of Seoul housing  property index \") +\n  theme_bw()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe ACF shows a very large positive spike at lag 1 (approximately 0.87), followed by strong positive spikes at lags 2 (0.70) and 3 (0.52), with a clear exponential decay pattern continuing through about lag 7. After lag 7, correlations become small but some remain just outside bounds. The PACF shows a massive spike at lag 1 (around 0.87) and then all subsequent lags remain within the confidence bounds. This series seems NOT stationary even after first differencing. The extremely high lag 1 autocorrelation and slow decay in the ACF strongly suggest that first differencing was insufficient. For this, second order differencing will be conducted later.\n\n\n\n\nCode\n#log\n\nusd_dlog &lt;- diff(usd_ts_log) \n\nggAcf(usd_dlog,lag.max = 50) +\n  geom_segment(aes(xend = lag, yend = 0), color=\"blue\") +\n  labs(title = \"Differenced: ACF of USD index\") +\n  theme_bw()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCode\nggPacf(usd_dlog,lag.max = 50) +\n  geom_segment(aes(xend = lag, yend = 0), color=\"red\") +\n  labs(title = \"Differenced: PACF of USD index\") +\n  theme_bw()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe ACF shows small correlations scattered throughout all lags, with most remaining within the confidence bounds. There are a few lags that barely exceed the bounds (notably around lags 1, 20, and 30), but the magnitudes are very small (all under 0.04). The PACF displays a similar pattern with many small spikes scattered across lags, with a couple just exceeding the bounds around lags 1, 20, and 30, but again all are small in magnitude. This differenced series appears to be stationary. The lack of any strong patterns in both ACF and PACF, combined with the very small magnitudes of all correlations, suggests that first differencing has successfully removed the non-stationary component.\n\n\n\n\nCode\n#log\n\nkospi_dlog &lt;- diff(kospi_ts_log) \n\nggAcf(kospi_dlog,lag.max = 50) +\n  geom_segment(aes(xend = lag, yend = 0), color=\"blue\") +\n  labs(title = \"Differenced: ACF of KOSPI index\") +\n  theme_bw()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCode\nggPacf(kospi_dlog,lag.max = 50) +\n  geom_segment(aes(xend = lag, yend = 0), color=\"red\") +\n  labs(title = \"Differenced: PACF of KOSPI index\") +\n  theme_bw()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe ACF shows small positive correlations at various lags, with no strong decay pattern. Most lags remain within bounds, though there are noticeable spikes at lags around 1, 12-13, and 48-49, all staying relatively small in magnitude (under 0.03). The PACF shows a similar scattered pattern with small spikes throughout, with slightly larger ones at lags 1, 12, and 48, but most correlations are close to zero and within the confidence bounds. This differenced series appears to be stationary. The correlations are all very small, suggesting that first differencing has effectively removed the trend component.\n\n\n\n\nCode\n#log \n\nsp_dlog &lt;- diff(sp_ts_log) \n\nggAcf(sp_dlog,lag.max = 50) +\n  geom_segment(aes(xend = lag, yend = 0), color=\"blue\") +\n  labs(title = \"Differenced: ACF of S&P500 index\") +\n  theme_bw()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCode\nggPacf(sp_dlog,lag.max = 50) +\n  geom_segment(aes(xend = lag, yend = 0), color=\"red\") +\n  labs(title = \"Differenced: PACF of S&P500 index\") +\n  theme_bw()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe ACF shows small correlations scattered across all lags with no clear decay pattern.

The PACF displays a similar pattern with scattered small spikes, including some that exceed bounds at lags 7, 13, 15, 28, and 32, but again all are small in magnitude. This differenced series appears to be stationary.

good for short-term shifts but still choppy. MA6 trims a lot of the month-to-month noise and captures inflections earlier than MA12. MA12 is the smoothest but lags notably—during the 2024–25 jump it under-shoots the peak and turns later.\nFederal Funds rate — MA3 / MA6 / MA12 Same pattern: MA3 tracks near the target with small oscillations; MA6 balances smoothness with timely turns. MA12 best shows the multi-year regimes but reacts last to both the pandemic-era lift-off and the latest easing hints.\nKRW/USD spot — MA50 / MA100 / MA200 MA50 responds fastest to swings and gives earlier crossover signals but whipsaws more. MA100 is a middle road, filtering short bursts yet catching medium-term trends. MA200 is very stable, ideal for the long-run dollar trend versus KRW, but it will miss shorter cycles.\nKorea–US trade imports — MA12 / MA24 / MA36 MA12 preserves seasonal/short business-cycle movements and shows timing of surges and slowdowns best. MA24 reduces those oscillations and highlights the underlying climb. MA36 smooths heavily and is useful for long-horizon trend levels, at the cost of noticeable lag at turning points.\nKorea–US trade exports — MA12 / MA24 / MA36 MA12 captures export accelerations and dips quickly, helpful for monitoring momentum. MA24 dampens volatility and clarifies medium-term expansions. MA36 offers a clean structural trend but turns well after the fact in the 2020s cycle.\nUS–KR 3-year yield spread — MA50 / MA100 / MA200 MA50 reacts early to spread reversals and flags regime changes first, though it’s twitchier. MA100 stabilizes the shape and still picks up the 2020–25 upswing in good time. MA200 is the steadiest—great for high-level regime view—but late at both troughs and peaks.\nUS–KR 10-year yield spread — MA50 / MA100 / MA200 Similar trade-offs: MA50 is most responsive and catches shifts around the 2010s and mid-2020s quickly. MA100 smooths without losing medium-term timing. MA200 gives a slow, clear secular picture of narrowing then widening spreads with the most lag.\nSeoul housing index — MA12 / MA24 / MA36 MA12 spots the crest and rollover quickest in the early-2020s. MA24 offers a cleaner arc of the cycle, muting month-to-month noise. MA36 is very smooth but lates the post-peak stabilization, so better for policy/structural views than timing.\nUSD Index — MA50 / MA100 / MA200 MA50 catches tactical swings and crossover signals, but it flips more often. MA100 nicely summarizes medium-run trends. MA200 shows the secular dollar waves (’80s peak, 2000s rise, 2010s base) and is the least noisy, with the largest delay.\nKOSPI — MA50 / MA100 / MA200 MA50 is most sensitive—good for momentum but prone to whipsaw in selloffs/rebounds. MA100 cuts a lot of noise yet reacts within a reasonable window. MA200 defines bull/bear phases and major supports; excellent for long-term risk posture, slow for entries/exits."

    "text": "Time series analyis in US economics influence on South korea’s economics\n1\nThe United States is the world’s largest economy and, in many ways, the bellwether of global finance. When U.S. economic or political events unfold—rate decisions, inflation surprises, policy shocks—markets everywhere react. Countries tightly connected to the U.S. through trade, capital flows, and technology supply chains feel these ripples most acutely.\nSouth Korea is a prime example. Its economy is deeply integrated with the U.S. through manufacturing-led exports, advanced technology industries, and financial linkages. U.S. shifts in growth, interest rates, and risk sentiment can quickly feed into Korea’s exchange rate, equity market, local interest rates, corporate financing conditions, and real activity. Korean policymakers and investors therefore watch the U.S. closely—adapting policy stances and portfolio strategies to absorb or harness these external forces.\nThis project explores how and how much U.S. ecomoics transmit to Korea’s economy and markets.This project focus on the dynamics : the channels of influence (rate differentials, dollar liquidity, risk appetite, growth signals), the speed and persistence of the effects, and how these relationships change across calm and stressed periods.\n\n\nbig picture\nThis project centers on how U.S. Treasuries—the world’s benchmark for risk-free returns—shape outcomes in Korea’s economy and markets. Treasury moves are not just bond-market trivia; they anchor rates, funding costs, and the global appetite for risk. When the U.S. curve shifts or policy guidance changes, the ripple travels quickly through the won–dollar exchange rate, Korean equities (KOSPI/KODEX), local interest rates and credit, and—after a lag—into the real economy via trade and housing. In short, U.S. rates transmit policy signals and real-economy shocks across markets; Korea, as an open, export-driven economy tightly linked to U.S. demand and capital, feels these waves early and often. By organizing evidence across FX, rates, market behavior, and real-side indicators, this project aims to builds a coherent narrative of how U.S. financial conditions connect to Korean financial and economic outcomes. The goal is to track how U.S. economic condition interacts with Korea’s economics, using a time-series workflow—aligning frequencies. This project will focus on five main ideas:\n\nU.S. rate shocks\n\nU.S. Treasury moves embed changing views about policy, inflation, and growth. this project analyzes how these shocks reach Korea through interest-rate differentials, dollar liquidity/risk sentiment, and growth expectations—and when those channels amplify or offset one another.\n\nFX market\n\nBecause FX sits at the center of global pricing and funding, USD/KRW often reacts first. We map when U.S. rate spikes strengthen the dollar and weaken the won, when those moves act as risk-off signals, and how quickly (or slowly) the effects fade.\n\ngovernment bond yield:\n\nThe KTB curve summarizes Korea’s borrowing costs and growth/inflation expectations. We examine how shifts in the U.S. curve pass through to KTB 3Y/10Y and credit spreads, identifying where transmission is sharp versus sticky, and how it differs across calm and stressed regimes.\n\nEquities:\n\nEquities translate rate information into valuations and earnings expectations. We track how sector leadership changes when discount rates rise or fall, spotlighting moments when stocks confirm the message from rates—or contradict it.\n\nReal economics:\n\nFinancial impulses filter into activity with lags. We connect market shocks to export prices/volumes and housing prices/transactions, clarifying when higher rates and a stronger dollar translate into softer trade momentum or tighter real-estate financing—and when resilience shows up instead.\nBy the end, this project aims to turn these signals into clear, practical guidance: how U.S. Treasury dynamics move Korea’s FX, rates, equities, trade, and housing—and how that understanding can inform policy calibration and resilient portfolio construction.\n\n\n\nAnalytical Angels\n\nUS-Korea Yield & policy rate: U.S. Treasury yields in most cases lead global funding costs and shape risk sentiment. Korea’s yield curve, in turn, reflects how those global impulses meet local policy and liquidity conditions. This project analyzes how U.S. rate shifts whether policy, inflation, or term-premium driven transmit into Korean rates and the Korean won.\nFX: FX sits at the center of global pricing and funding, often reacting first for economic shock. This project maps when U.S. rate spikes strengthen the dollar and weaken the won, when those moves act as risk-off signals, and how quickly (or slowly) the effects fade and links to change in various financial markets such as FX, Bonds.\nEquities: Equities translate rate information into valuations and earnings expectations. This project tracks how leadership changes when rates rise or fall—testing when KOSPI co-moves with the US market and the dollar/risk complex, and spotlighting moments when stocks confirm the message from rates or contradict it.\nHousing market :Housing market is one of the markets that is very sensitive to economic index. This project connects market shocks to export prices/volumes and housing prices/transactions, clarifying when higher rates and a stronger dollar translate into softer trade momentum or tighter real-estate financing.\nTrade: Fundamentals in Korea’s economy relies on exports/imports. The trade channels global demand, dollar strength, and financing costs into shipment volumes and pricing. This project examines how USD strength and U.S.–Korea rate spreads affect export/imports when U.S. growth momentum offsets FX/risk.\n\n\n\nGuiding Questions\n\nHow do U.S. Treasury yield changes transmit through Korea’s financial system (FX, rates, equities, credit)?\nWhat is the best way to identify a U.S. rate shock — event-day surprises, residualized yields, or structural VAR identification?\nWhat is the size of the pass-through elasticity between U.S. and Korean yields (e.g., dKTB3Y/dUST2Y, dKTB10Y/dUST10Y)?\nWhich Korean market reacts first and strongest to U.S. shocks, and what is the typical lag structure of these reactions?\nHow does the strength and speed of transmission vary across regimes — high VIX, Fed tightening cycles, or funding stress periods?\nDo FX, rate, and equity responses move consistently after shocks, or do they diverge (e.g., rates up, stocks steady)?\nHow do U.S. financial shocks spill over into Korea’s real economy — exports, industrial production, and housing — over time?\nAre U.S. rate hikes and cuts symmetric in their effects on Korea’s markets and economy?\nWhat share of Korea’s financial-market volatility is explained by U.S. shocks versus domestic or regional factors?\nWhat actionable signals should Korean policymakers and investors monitor — U.S. front-end policy, long-end term premium, or dollar liquidity indicators?\n\n\n\nLiterature reviews\n\nUS–Korea yield & rate\n\nRecent evidence shows US Treasury moves often lead other curves, with term-premium and expectations shocks radiating into global funding costs—consistent with the view that Korea’s KTB curve imports a sizable share of the US signal unless domestic policy/liquidity conditions push back (BIS, 2024)2. This motivates our decomposition of KTB moves into imported expectations vs local term-premium and our tests for wedge episodes when BoK priorities (growth/financial stability) resist external tightening.\n\nFX\n\nNew work from the Bank of Korea highlights the dollar’s outsized role in transmitting US financial shocks to small open economies, including Korea, via both trade invoicing and dollar funding channels (Bank of Korea, 2025)3. This supports our focus on mapping how US rate spikes strengthen the dollar, pressure the won, and cascade into local funding and asset prices—while testing state dependence (calm vs stressed) in the speed and persistence of KRW pass-through.\n\nEquities\n\nThe IMF’s 2025 Global Financial Stability Report documents elevated equity valuations alongside heightened sensitivity to rate and policy-uncertainty shocks, with correlations to long-rate moves rising in risk-on phases (IMF, 2025)4. This informs our approach to track when KOSPI co-moves with US equities and the dollar/risk complex—confirming the discount-rate channel—and when local earnings or sector dynamics generate divergence from the message embedded in rates.\n\nHousing market\n\nThe IMF’s 2024 Article IV for Korea, assesses housing affordability and interest-rate transmission, noting how tighter financial conditions and higher mortgage costs can weigh on transactions/prices even as some stabilization emerges (IMF, 2025)5. We use this to link imported rate/FX shocks to mortgage proxies, volumes, and prices, distinguishing quick volume effects from slower price adjustments and identifying thresholds where financing tightens materially.\n\nTrade\n\nBIS research after 2023 emphasizes valuation effects under dominant-currency pricing: exchange-rate swings reshape firms’ cash flows and can outweigh classic expenditure-switching in the short run (Nookhwun et al., 2025)6. This frames our tests of how USD strength and US–Korea rate spreads filter into Korea’s export receipts and import bills—and when strong US growth offsets FX/risk headwinds for volumes and pricing.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReferences\n\n1.
